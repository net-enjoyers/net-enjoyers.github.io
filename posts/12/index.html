But it is not necessarily an overspending one, actually, I spend less than I earn and manage to save money for bigger buys and investments. My problem is mostly connected with emotions, especially guilt when I feel like I am spending too much on daily basis but at the end of the month, everything is fine. And this guilt does not come from spending too much because I would categorize myself as a defensive spender. It mostly comes out of the feeling of the unknown.</p><p>I do not know how much I spend weekly, I do not plan ahead, I just trust my intuition and some really basic calculations like: <code>divide all the money by the days left</code> so I know how much I can spend today. But right now I want to point out one thing - <strong>it works</strong>. It is a very effective one when you are on a low unexpected budget, I mean you are a student. You do not have much money to spend and do not know when a spontaneous trip or party will pop up. You just live day by day trying to survive ;D</p><p>But what got me here won&rsquo;t get me there. I believe in systematic thinking and try not to trust my mind too much on things that a great designed system can take care of. And that is something I have been looking for: a way to systemize my finances so I spend on important things and have spare money to travel, have fun and invest.</p><p>I felt especially motivated after a really mind-opening event happened. I was at the bakery and the lady before me asked the seller about the price of every cake and later summed up with the words: &ldquo;the cheapest one please&rdquo;. At that very moment, I thought: I do not want to live like this.</p><p>Now is the perfect moment to figure out my personal budgeting, I have begun to earn my own money and I am on course to my financial independence. I want my future to be stress-free and planned ahead. I want to enter the shop (or website) and know how much money I can spend. Get rid of this emotional burden of calculating how much I can spend and buy things with the best value-to-price ratio. To make the best consumer decision.</p><p>My first action point was to look for a budgeting app, I downloaded one which looked promising. It had lots of features, categories, summaries, and reports. But it was nothing new for me, just a more fancy UI than opening my bank account. I wanted something better. So I googled &ldquo;best budgeting app&rdquo; and there was a blog post with &ldquo;best apps&rdquo; on the list one clicked for me &ldquo;YNAB - zero-based budgeting&rdquo;. Interesting name + not yet known term, perfect. One funny thing I remember is that on-site listed &ldquo;UI feels nothing more than excel spreadsheet&rdquo; as a con but for me, it was a pro ;D</p><p>My first impression was really odd, I connected my bank account, and added expenses and inflows but actually I did not quite get what they were talking about. At this moment came the section &ldquo;Help&rdquo; - literally something I was taught my whole life to avoid (thanks windows). There was a 30 min <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFXIJcyv-Pc">explanatory video</a> on how to set up a budget inside an app, click by click. And watching along with it I caught that I had some misconceptions about it. It defines a domain of the problem a bit differently, instead of focusing on certain amounts of money and expenses you focus on assigning money to categories.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>you have 100$ in your bank account

now you assign it to categories

groceries : 50$
clothes : 25$
transport : 25$

in the grocery store you open your budget and see exactly how much you can spend

you can divide your budgets weekly 
you can set bigger goals which span longer e.g. christmas gifts.
</code></pre><p>I discovered this app today but already can recommend it. It introduced me to a new mental model for thinking about budgeting - <a href=https://www.investopedia.com/envelope-budgeting-system-5208026>envelope budgeting</a>. It made me think about what I want to accomplish and search outside of my mind for a solution. Escape the cognitive illusion that I cannot take care of it and it will and should be the pain for time being.</p><p>I want to give it a try in the upcoming month and look forward to documenting my thoughts.</p><h2 id=vagus-nerve-can-boost-your-moodhttpswwwshondalandcomlivebodya40577718learn-how-your-vagus-nerve-can-boost-your-mood><a href=https://www.shondaland.com/live/body/a40577718/learn-how-your-vagus-nerve-can-boost-your-mood/>Vagus Nerve can boost your mood</a></h2><blockquote><p>You spot a snake on the side of the trail, just a step or two away. You freeze for a moment. Your breath quickens, heart races, and eyes widen. You look closer and realize the snake is actually just a stick. Instinctively, you take a deep breath and let out a long exhalation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>That action actually stimulated your vagus nerve, which instantly told your body, “We’re all good.”</p></blockquote><p>It instantly caught my attention because it could sympathize with this feeling. The idea of using this brain mechanic for my own purpose seemed at least intriguing. Seemed like a low-hanging fruit that can be caught with very little effort. And indeed it is.</p><blockquote><p>With each inhalation, the heart rate speeds up slightly. And with each exhalation, it slows down.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To stimulate the vagus nerve, simply extend your exhaling. For example, you might breathe in for a count of four and out for a count of eight.</p></blockquote><p>It really worked for me, and I am not just saying. I had a quite stressful time in my life when I traveled abroad, and so many uncertainties appear in my consciousness. Some cause fear and panic. And in these moments I just tried to exhale longer than I inhale. And it did wonders. Very simple exercise but when used correctly can be really impactful.</p><p>I strive for things like this, simple tools to produce extraordinary effects.</p></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><hr>⚡️
