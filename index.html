Things that are advanced and high-tech are by nature required to be complex beyond our comprehension. Have you ever step into a core C++ function or a class while debugging? Or maybe you tried to read a specification about some format to implement it and learn how it works. If so you experienced the sheer terror that awakes when stuff like GLIBC source code is on your screen.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/fifth/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/fourth/>Link collection: 4</a></h1><time>Mar 28, 2022</time><br><div class=description>Mateusz BOOKSTORES: How to Read More Books in the Golden Age of Content Living in the &ldquo;golden age of content&rdquo; has many benefits. You can basically watch anything, anywhere, anytime. Servers do not sleep, phones are slim and the extension of your arms and companies want to have the most diverse content catalogue. Information is all around us, yet I&rsquo;d argue that sadly we are slipping into medieval fairy tails and folklore rather than grounded knowledge and scientifically proven facts.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/fourth/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/third/>Link collection: 3</a></h1><time>Mar 14, 2022</time><br><div class=description>Mateusz Wide-band WebSDR Electromagnetic radiation is a spectrum so incredibly attached to today&rsquo;s humans it&rsquo;s hard to imagine life without it. From radio, WiFi, Bluetooth, 4G/5G, TV, Roentgen pictures and to the most important - visible light. It&rsquo;s all around us, thanks to it, you are able to read these words. But such a high number of these is invisible to us it might actually not exist. How do so many of these great technologies work, communicating (at the speed of light!&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/third/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/second/>Link collection: 2</a></h1><time>Feb 28, 2022</time><br><div class=description>Mateusz Taking a look back to materials that made a lasting impression on me very few blog posts come to mind. I take this as a weakness of mine, but I ask for your attention regardless.
Physics is going to be finished in six months Thinking that you are something greater that you really are, is a trope that each homo sapiens embodies. Being an expert in a given field boosts your confidence to absurd levels but not equally in each specialization.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/second/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/first/>Link collection: 1</a></h1><time>Feb 16, 2022</time><br><div class=description>Mateusz Efficiently Generating a Number in a Range You never thought about your random number generator. It just worked and you never noticed it to be off - except maybe for it&rsquo;s slow performance. Meanwhile this posts proves that there are people that are thinking about this like it&rsquo;s the basis of computing. Going over every little detail from correctness (!) and speed, and still one upping each-other on their implementation.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/first/>Read more ⟶</a></section></main><footer><hr>⚡️
