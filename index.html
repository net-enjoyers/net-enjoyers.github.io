But it is not necessarily an overspending one, actually, I spend less than I earn and manage to save money for bigger buys and investments.

I had a big problem with passing one of the lessons in Duolingo Chinese course. Lesson was about magic words 谢谢 (thank you) and 对不起 (I&rsquo;m sorry).
What took me by surprise was the struggle that I had with the responses to those magic words.
When someone says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; you respond with 没关系 (no problem). When someone says &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; you respond with 不客气 (you&rsquo;re welcome) I literally tried to pass the lesson like 5 or 6 times and every time I failed on the phrase &ldquo;No problem&rdquo;.&mldr;</div><a href=/posts/11/>Read more ⟶</a></section><section class=list-item><h1 class=title><a href=/posts/10/>Link collection: 10</a></h1><time>Jun 28, 2022</time><br><div class=description>Mateusz Where Does Bad Code Come From?

Things that are advanced and high-tech are by nature required to be complex beyond our comprehension. Have you ever step into a core C++ function or a class while debugging? Or maybe you tried to read a specification about some format to implement it and learn how it works.
