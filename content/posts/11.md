## [You're welcome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79DijItQXMM)

Very interesting situation has happened to me today. I had a big problem with passing one of the lessons in Duolingo Chinese course. Lesson was about magic words [谢谢 (thank you)](https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=worddict&wdrst=0&wdqb=thank+you) and [对不起 (I'm sorry)](https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=worddict&wdrst=0&wdqb=excuse+me). 

What took me by surprise was the struggle that I had with the responses to those magic words. 
- When someone says "I'm sorry" you respond with [没关系 (no problem)](没关系). 
- When someone says "Thank you" you respond with [不客气 (you're welcome)](不客气)

I literally tried to pass the lesson like 5 or 6 times and every time I failed on the phrase "No problem". Because for me it was the response for either "I'm sorry" or "Thank you". Duolingo really triggered me. For good.

I searched on the internet, net enjoyer I am indeed, and found the answer. In Chinese they use "No problem" only to reply to other's requests. You cannot answer "No problem" to "Thank you". Explanation [3:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_j7sxxW078).

> "No problem" != "You're welcome". They cannot be used interchangeably in Chinese.

I dug deeper, net enjoyer is my second name, and found even more interesting stuff. Chinese society has very different perspective on saying thank you, it is mostly used during interaction with a stranger, where a clear boundary can be felt. But actually inside of families they rarely say thank you or I love you, because it sort of establishes boundaries between two parties, making interaction more of an value exchange (which is very Western way of looking at relations). 

Interesting resources I stumbled upon:

> Great question! And there is actually an answer. China is a very Confucian society, and as such, Chinese people are taught to be very polite to strangers. Politeness includes saying things like, “Thank you,” ”Please,” etc. You will find that, if you are on a Chinese street and you, say, help an old lady down from the bus, she and her daughter will profusely thank you.

> However, Chinese close friends and family actually do say polite things, they just do not say it outright. For example, if a good friend went out of his or her way to cook for you, instead of saying, “Thank you for cooking for me!” (which would make them unconfortable as being too polite and distant), they will often say, 你辛苦了！ which means, “You worked hard!” It is their way of saying thank you, without actually saying it directly.

> My Chinese friends say they notice that Westerners use lots of pleases (qǐng) and thank yous (xiexie) when speaking Chinese. And actually, they say, we use way too many of them for Chinese taste. A Chinese linguist, Kaidi Zhan, says that using a please, as in “Please pass the salt,” actually has the opposite effect of politeness here in China. The Chinese way of being polite to each other with words is to shorten the social distance between you. And saying please serves to insert a kind of buffer or space that says, in effect, that we need some formality between us here. “Good friends are so close, they are like part of you,” Danny said. “Why would you say please or thank you to yourself? It doesn’t make sense.”

> This essay strikes me as someone fetishizing a culture, deeming it "mysterious", and trying to find great meaning in the self-imposed mysteries, when simpler explanations are at hand. 

Reading through forum answers we can clearly see with how complex phenomenon we are dealing. Culture is a living organism, everyone has its own context, experience and opinion. It is very hard to come up with definitive judgement and summary. 

But definitely the Chinese culture has a different perspective on the word "thank you" because it can be seen in the very result of this culture, language.
