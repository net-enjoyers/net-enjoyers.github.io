## [Down the ergonomic keyboard rabbit hole](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2020/10/09/ergo-rabbit-hole.html)

Realizing that working on a computer will destroy your body if you do not take care of it is the better the sooner it comes.
Buying equipment that will aid in your work is money not spent but invested.
If you will have to stop working in the field you know most about because you can't physically do it is money lost.
Money is not you and your work is not you.
But what when what you do in work starts creeping into your regular life.
I started having hand pains that where at first barely noticeable and later turn to mild.
Well aware of the fact that if I ignore this it's an easy way to get RSI.
My mind running over all the darkest scenarios resulted in stress that was not necessary.
Comfort - is something that cannot be bought when it's lost.

Buying the Ergodox Ez seemed like a sheepish thing to do but guess what...
It actually help and my hands are _much_ better!
My mental health also improved because I'm not worried that I'll be forced to stop doing what I love.
To thread my needle through the blog post even more: layouts.
How each human has a different layout and most Ergodox Ez's are unique and used to the fullest extent only by their creators.
I strongly recommend reading this blog post if you thing about getting an ergonomic keyboard in any way, shape or form.
And if you think whether to buy something that you think will help your health...
Do it.
If it doesn't help, you don't like it or anything else just sell it.
You might lose some money, but now you gained some knowledge and all is even in the universe.

## [Sometimes, it is a compiler bug](https://quick-lint-js.com/blog/bug-journey/)

I guess that the only reason that I attach this here is because it was pleasant to read.
You might've picked up on the fact that I like this kind of things - low level.
There is not much that I can say about this except that we rely on things to be right.
And sometimes we forget that everything is brittle, some things more than others but electricity is not here to stay forever.
We have to maintain things we rely on, this in turn allows us to build higher and higher abstractions upon them.
Anything that we can call a foundation is not a solved problem because mostly they're not solved, they're brute-forced at a bigger scale.
The problem of energy in the universe is something that nobody yet has cracked and that sentence is not true I'm very interested about the world you live in - do cars fly?.

Back to the point.
GNU utils are such a monolith that it is impossible to change anything in them.
What are we going to do when most of the people that work on them will inevitably die?
The famous question of: What if Linus Torvalds falls under a bus?
These projects need to evolve which is sad because I think we need a revolution.
[musl](https://musl.libc.org/) shows that you can do it the correct way, so when are we going to pay of this gigantic technical debt?
I myself believe that never from which you can only surmise that we as individuals need to start creating/relying on things that are revolutions upon the beaten path.

## [Norawy Fjord Cruise](https://wypiszwymalujpodroz.pl/praktyczny-poradnik/europa/norwegia/rejs-po-fiordach/)

I want to go to Norway, I have been saving money for half a year to go on a vacation somewhere, my first idea was London, but actually visiting Keukenhof in Amsterdam changed my mind, natural wonders are just the best thing you can see, that should be your top priority, this feeling is unprecedented, incomparable, your body is loving it and completely new emotion arises.

This blog post was superhelpful and allowed me to think about my idea rationally. I stopped doubting that it is impossible, get rid of the assumption that it will be too hard for me. We are in dire need of 'someone has done it before'. While it is important and that's how our society is build, at the same time I have a gut feeling that relying too much on something that happened before leads us only to maintainace of our society. Growth and change is only possible by those little moments of bravery and creativity, when we do something that has not been done before. 

Probably it all leads to a balance of new and old, of inventing and recreating, of forcing and reinforcing. For me it is very important to have this spontaneous spark from time to time, when I decide to e.g. learn chinese or travel to Norway. I feel like this gives my life extra flavour. It is like refueling my inner energy tank and opening new motorways where I can ride.

I highly recommend to do something worth living from time to time, to listen to your inner voice. I don't want to this to be a cheap motivational speech, I am not talking about some distant thing. I mean just inject some new ideas into your mind, it can as simple as be brushing your teeth with other hand or as complicated as moving to other country. What I am trying to convey is to try being active at changing your world perspective, because it can only be wider.

## [103 Bits of Advice I Wish I Had Known](https://kk.org/thetechnium/103-bits-of-advice-i-wish-i-had-known/)

So much knowledge in one place, that is sometimes even more valuable than knowledge itself. We see people as experts, but at the end of the day they are just knowledge stores that gathered so much data, point of views, made mistakes, got practice, created something. All of this leads to an unprecedented thought process that allows them to grasp the problem and it becomes first order citizen in their mind, where they can almost interact with it in their mind. 

I wonder what is the shape of thought. Why some are remembered. Why some just feel better. Is it common thing to enjoy thinking. Because I really do, from time to time to just sit and gaze at one point, and allow thoughts to float on the horizon. 

We all have gazillions of thought, tons of life experiences, but how to summarize them? Author in this post decided to gather multiple valuable pieces of advice in one place. I am very grateful for this post, it can be read many times and it keeps on giving.

## [The Mindset Gap](https://fs.blog/brain-food/may-1-2022/)

We should all be thought mindset, everything I truly learned is because I got certain mindset, you get this from entering groups that are having traits you want to have or spending time reading, but I would say groups have way stronger influence and can change you more as a human being. Finding group that you want to learn and committing will lead you to great success, and what is even more important, will allow you to get to know yourself in new setting.

I want to understand what the mindset is, how to teach other people mindset. The world would be such a better place with it. Knowledge would flow more easily. Conflicts would be solved. Questions would be answered.

Funny thing is that most of the time you don't lack skills, you lack mindset. And it is very tricky to learn it. It is even impossible to learn it. You have to think in a certain way, you want to be a programmer? you have to think like programmer. And how to think like programmer? That is the question I want to answer in the future.
