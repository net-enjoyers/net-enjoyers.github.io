## [Down the ergonomic keyboard rabbit hole](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2020/10/09/ergo-rabbit-hole.html)

Realizing that working on a computer will destroy your body if you do not take care of it is the better the sooner it comes.
Buying equipment that will aid in your work is money not spent but invested.
If you will have to stop working in the field you know most about because you can't physically do it is money lost.
Money is not you and your work is not you.
But what when what you do in work starts creeping into your regular life.
I started having hand pains that where at first barely noticeable and later turn to mild.
Well aware of the fact that if I ignore this it's an easy way to get RSI.
My mind running over all the darkest scenarios resulted in stress that was not necessary.
Comfort - is something that cannot be bought when it's lost.

Buying the Ergodox Ez seemed like a sheepish thing to do but guess what...
It actually help and my hands are _much_ better!
My mental health also improved because I'm not worried that I'll be forced to stop doing what I love.
To thread my needle through the blog post even more: layouts.
How each human has a different layout and most Ergodox Ez's are unique and used to the fullest extent only by their creators.
I strongly recommend reading this blog post if you thing about getting an ergonomic keyboard in any way, shape or form.
And if you think whether to buy something that you think will help your health...
Do it.
If it doesn't help, you don't like it or anything else just sell it.
You might lose some money, but now you gained some knowledge and all is even in the universe.

## [Sometimes, it is a compiler bug](https://quick-lint-js.com/blog/bug-journey/)

I guess that the only reason that I attach this here is because it was pleasant to read.
You might've picked up on the fact that I like this kind of things - low level.
There is not much that I can say about this except that we rely on things to be right.
And sometimes we forget that everything is brittle, some things more than others but electricity is not here to stay forever.
We have to maintain things we rely on, this in turn allows us to build higher and higher abstractions upon them.
Anything that we can call a foundation is not a solved problem because mostly they're not solved, they're brute-forced at a bigger scale.
The problem of energy in the universe is something that nobody yet has cracked and that sentence is not true I'm very interested about the world you live in - do cars fly?.

Back to the point.
GNU utils are such a monolith that it is impossible to change anything in them.
What are we going to do when most of the people that work on them will inevitably die?
The famous question of: What if Linus Torvalds falls under a bus?
These projects need to evolve which is sad because I think we need a revolution.
[musl](https://musl.libc.org/) shows that you can do it the correct way, so when are we going to pay of this gigantic technical debt?
I myself believe that never from which you can only surmise that we as individuals need to start creating/relying on things that are revolutions upon the beaten path.

## [Norawy Fjord Cruise](https://wypiszwymalujpodroz.pl/praktyczny-poradnik/europa/norwegia/rejs-po-fiordach/)

I want to go to Norway, I have been saving money for half a year to go on a vacation somewhere, my first idea was London, but actually visiting Keukenhof in Amsterdam changed my mind, natural wonders are just the best thing you can see, that should be your top priority, this feeling is unprecedneted, uncompareable, your body is fucking loving it, i want this and will do it


This blogpost was superhelpful and allowed me to come from dream to true, i was full of doubts, thought it is hard, but just story of two students that went in a reasonalbe amount of money compelled to me

## [103 Bits of Advice I Wish I Had Known](https://kk.org/thetechnium/103-bits-of-advice-i-wish-i-had-known/)

So much knwoledge in one place, that is sometimes even more valuable than knwoledge itself. We evaulate people because they have knowledge, experts, but at the end of the day they are knwoledge stores that gathered so many data, point of views, made mistakes, got practice, created something. All of this leads to an unprecedented thought process that allows them to grasp the problem and it becomes first order citizen in their mind, where thay can almost physicallly in their mind interact with the problem. I wonder what is the shape of thought, I sometimes can feel my thoughts.

## [The Mindset Gap](https://fs.blog/brain-food/may-1-2022/)

We should all be thought mindset, everything I truly learned is because I got certain mindset, you get this from entering groups that are having traits you want to have or spending time reading, but I would say groups are way stronger
I want to teach others mindset, really
