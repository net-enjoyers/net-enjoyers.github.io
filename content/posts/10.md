## [Where Does Bad Code Come From?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YpFGkG-u1w)

I never had a real in person mentor that I would take from piles of knowledge and in times of trouble I'd think to myself "How would he approach this problem?".
Casey Muratori has been to me - code-wise at least - the closest thing to a mentor I ever had.
Being curious about the world view someone has on a given subject shows that you respect that person.
And I have nothing but respect for Casey and what he achieved with the Handmade Hero series.
For me he's the person we - young generation of programmers - need to show us that most of the pretty talk around is just fluff that does not walk the walk.
This talk might be the amalgamation of all the things that are preached by Casey.
And most of this boils down to the fact that we should strive to be engineers and our choices should have some support other than "He said that it's better that way".
If you can't measure it, it does not exist.
Saying that [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) has to be seen for what it is, a king without pants.

> With all the stuff I just said it's effectively like instead of giving them something like a compass we just give them tools that don't make any sense.
> We give them like a hammer and a tape measure or something like that.
> And we're like "Here you go. Set off on this journey, here's a hammer".
> Now the worst part about it is it's not even as bad as giving someone a hammer because the real world person would know that the hammer is useless and throw it away.
> We've told them that this hammer is critical for navigation so they're like trying to like hold it up to the sun or something and figure out which direction they're going.
> They have no idea that we've given them tools that are not even relevant to the problem that they're solving.
> They're not actually tools that measure anything.
> They're just arbitrary.
> We just gave them to them and said here you go.

## [The 36 Questions That Lead to Love](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/09/style/no-37-big-wedding-or-small.html)

Given how suggestive the title might be, it's not necessarily about falling in love.
It's about being vulnerable around someone and them being vulnerable around you.
Your partner, family or close friends are good matches if you just want to see how these questions allow oneself to slowly but surely open before someone.
The deeper you dig inside yourself the more things you find that you thought were inconsequential turn out to be the building blocks that make you-you.
In the deepest parts of your psyche there is nothing, you have no personality.
You have fears and desires.
Everything else is just built as an abstraction around the core of your emotions.
What you thought was you is just an outward facing facade that allows emotions to flow from the core but keep it safe in the event of danger.

## [Black Country, New Road - 'Concorde'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjC4qXiBRu4)

Sharing art in the place where I talk about rocks that do basic math requires me to reveal my vulnerabilities.
But we all have them and what are we without emotions if not the same carbon-based calculators doing basic math and multiplying in numbers.

> Concorde, I miss you  
> Don't text me till winter  
> I can hardly afford  
> A second summer of splinters  
> This staircase, it leads only to  
> Some old pictures of you  
> Through an a-thousand-mile-long tube  
> What's a city boy to do?
