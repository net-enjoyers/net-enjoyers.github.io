# Antoni & Mateusz

Long time no see. Sorry for such a long break from posting but we were really busy learning for the exams and defending diploma thesis. Jokes aside, we were just lazy :=>

Instead of writing regular link collection today we are going to try something new. A discussion about certain topic. This piece will be an attempt to write one post, instead of writing two and merging them into one, as we used to do.
