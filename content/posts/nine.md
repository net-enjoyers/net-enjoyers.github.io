## [Trying too hard](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/trying-too-hard/?ref=refind)

> McCrae later wrote that he actually felt fortunate for having never heard of the rare disease.

Having an experience is a great power and with great power comes great responsibility. What is even more important than experience is the awareness of your experience, so every time you are starting to solve a problem you are aware of certain possibilities because of your experience. But, never, ever, be certain about the solution and rethink it approprietely. To be precise, I am not talking about small problems like which toothpaste to buy or whether to put logic inside a constructor. My focus is on more complex problems, non-linear, where there is not the best solution and you have to make a tradeoff. I don't want to become a person which when shown a complex problem sees a solution immediately. And when I become one please slap me in the face.

This is very important mental model (postawa) in communication. Everyone of us has certain experience in life, has met multiple people. We often ulegamy fallacy to grade (ocenić) someone based on our experience. We think that we have seen it before and we know the *correct* solution. That is the biggest fallacy in our perspective on communication, that there is an ideal solution, no there is not. Every situation is different and we should thrive to put mental processes when they are needed. To be more precise I am not talking about situation such as arguing whether we gave back money to someone or if yesterday was raining. I am talking about bigger ideas like social media usage and whether they are helpful. My personal experience is that I cannot use them but at the same time I see multiple use cases when they can be helpful provided that you spent enough time on tuning what u see and read. I never want to be person that tells someone to not use it without explaination or rethinking. I don't want to be close minded

> A truth that applies to almost every field is that it’s possible to try too hard, and when doing so you can get worse results than those who knew less, cared less, and put in less effort than you did.

I had this feeling multiple times, that I worked hard, spent so much time on something and at the end of the day comes someone and solves the problem in few minutes. This for a very long time was irritating for me and I was thinking bad about the others, that they are stupid and they don't know what they are doing and got lucky to find the solution. But what came to my realization lately is that most solutions are really simple and should be. What differs is the process it took to find it. For some it will take days, for some it will take minutes. Everyone is constructed differently and can see the world differently.

At the same time I do not want to be person from the previous paragraph, that acknowldges the situation. I want to be the person that is proactive in this matter and tries to find the simplest solution and not "walić głową w ścianę". I want to have the awareness when my mind is too tangled up and my thoughts lead me to no mans land. I want to have courage by myslef to admit that I was wrong and move on. Don't treat myself and everything so seriously, but rather treat it as mystery which should be seen, doesn't matter how you solved it and how many times you failed.

Now comes the scary part, the behaviour I have described before is being systematically enforced on people. Yes, we have zgotowaliśmy sobie.

> Being an expert from an era that no longer exists

Something didn't work in your era and you think it cannot work at all. But is very far from truth and can lead you in a very closed mind. The quote from Henry Ford really compelled with me *"I am not particularly anxious for the men to remember what someone else has tried to do in the past, for then we might quickly accumulate far too many things that could not be done."* I also remember the quote from my English teacher that told me about a boy that heard super fast guitar song and managed to learn to play it. When the author found out about it he had to see it with his own eyes because he thought it was impossible. He made the song by digitally tuning it to sound faster and thought it is impossible for human being to play that fast.

What these stories teach us is that we have to allow other people to make mistakes. I really want to be the person that allows others, including myself, to make mistakes, because only out of mistakes truly interesting things happen. 

I am really angry at current educational system because that is exactly the opposite of my words. But this is not the place for this elaborate. I will do my best to save my kids and hopefully next generation from this piece of crap.

> Career incentives can push complexity in a field where simplicity leads to the best outcomes.

This is like direct outcome of our current educational system. Falsely building autorytety and mkaing people to listen to them. Creating rules and making people to dumbly obey them, what is more, punish if you dont obey. Make a social pressure the be as everyone else. Yes, do not have to look no more, doctor giving you wrong prescription is being deceived by the same mental model that he learned at school. To be able to repeat, does not matter what.

## [How doctors choose to die](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/feb/08/how-doctors-choose-die)

Now coming back to more happy topic, death. Yes, for some it is a happy one, the doctors see death differently than we do. They are not afraid of it and want to optimise the process of dying. What really struck me is the lack of leczenie, because they see it only as prolonging of cierpienie. It is better to leave the world on your rules, happily, be remembered in a way that you want to.

> "Promise me that if you find me like this you'll kill me." They mean it. Some medical personnel wear medallions stamped "NO CODE" to tell physicians not to perform CPR on them.

It turns out that most life-saving techniques we are aware of are not necesarilly best for the patient. The part with CPR really struck I was not aware of it, that it does more harm than good, wow. 

> He went home the next day, closed his practice, and never set foot in a hospital again. He focused on spending time with his family and feeling as good as possible.

Doctors see death diffrently, the know the risks, the options, the pain that comes with it. So they make cold calculations and focus on personal well-being. That is counter to our culture which shows us on every corner to do everything possible to save life. You can surely imagine a movie scene when the family is crying when someone does not agree to for chemiotheraphy. We are seeing the death differently that the doctors, should it be this way? 

We have this basic instict written in our mind, to do everything to save someone, but maybe that should not be the default. Maybe we should look at death as part of the life and not get so emotional and panic, reconnect our society with death again. I bet in the past people talked about it as a normal thing, not it became a taboo which you want to avoid to not make others uncomfortable, which is plain old stupid. The more we avoid uncomfortability know the worse we will come when it finally come.

I have some fresh personal experience regarding this topic, and can assure that people that talk about possible death and are aware of it are the one ready for it. Others that avoid the topic are catch off guard and start to panic, behave unreasonabily. To be precise, I am not talking about the people dying, because when someone is dying he should be treated as partly unconciouss. I am talking about the people around the dying human. There are two possibilities currently:
1. the person before his illness communicated how to treat him in such situation
2. we don't know, we panic, we want to save him/her and do everything that is possible, because otherwise we will feel guilty

Unfonrtunately, currently construdted public debate and awareness about death does not include the third option:

3. we all have commone sense about dying and listen to the doctors, so we can optimise ill person last days to be comfortable for him/her

I encourage you to think about your own death, how would you see it, because that is the missing point of our debate. We taboo the topic not because it is uncomfortable, it is uncomforable for us, we don't want to think about out death. But that makes is unable to think about others people death and we treat it as the worst thing that can happen, so we loose our heads, panic, act unreasonabily. 

Don't think about your own death now, don't force it, but if the time comes don't be afraid. If someone around is dying don't change the topic but discuss it as you would do normally with other things. I think that is a great emotional investement to think about now, so later you can make better decisions and what is the most important feel better in such situation.

I want to end this with a big words of respect for the doctors who are doing their work as they think is best and don't fall into emotional rollercoaster because that is the ride when noone wins. The job of a doctor is almost impossible for me to imagine, the level of shit that you see. The level of sadness, panic, irrationalities, stupidity that you see on daily basis. You are like a guard for people where you guard them from themselves. Thank you.

## [Doing less bothers me](https://radreads.co/80-20-rule/?ref=refind)

Lately I am having this discomfort thoughts from time to time. That I am not doing enough, that there are so many options and I am passing on them. I know so many people but I am seeing only small fraction of it. So many interest areas but I am focusing only on few. This feeeling is very very uncomfortable and many times make me doubt whether I am lazy, conformist and passive.

I am aware of it and after some analising I deeply sure that this feeling is good for me. I am chaning my world perspective. I am changing how I was educated and wychowany. I am changing my own personal preferences and usposobienia. In broader time scope it finally allows me to accomplish things that were impossible for me. Before I was making plans to learn something e.g. programming. I thought, yeah, this summer I will learn it. In my mind it was like I have to work super hard, I have to make astronomiacal steps at a time, learn rocket science in one night. And it overwhelmed me, I was afraid to even start. What is more, I was bragging myself about inaction, i view myself as lazy, unproductive, unable, it really didn't help me. Toxic ambitions.

Now my perspective changed a bit, I am doing less, but consistently, and really that is a great realisation. I do not know when I truly realised it but I am thankful for it. Now I am more grounded in my goals, I know how much it takes to achieve them and that it will take many small steps instead of few big ones. And small steps are easy.

So I feel like everyday I am doing easy things, so I am not progressing, but at the same time if I look back I see tremendous progress. Very interesting feeling and I am still learning it. I hope with time I will be aware on dailiy basis about the importance of small steps and how they fit in bigger picture. So the doubts will sound funny in my head.

In Poland we have a saying "z Korwina się wyrasta", which means you grew out of certain things. My thesis is that we do not grew out but the thoughts about certain things just start to feel funny and unreasonable. We look through them. Spot false actors. Maybe growing up is like becoming a lie detector for ourselves?
