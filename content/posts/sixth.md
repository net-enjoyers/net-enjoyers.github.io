## [being old soul](https://betterhumans.pub/read-this-if-youre-an-old-soul-who-feels-lost-32bf4b52c417)

I heard about the term "old soul" few months ago during conversation with a guy from America. After exchange of thoughts and life experiences he told me that they have a name for my point of view in the US, I am na "old soul", I feel older than I am. This conversation was very eye-opening for me and stays in my mind to this day. <br>
When checking Refind I found article with this term in the title and it quickly caught my attention. After spending day sightseeing Amsterdam and meeting a girl from Ukraine with who I had really deep conversation about life I was in the right mood to read it. <br>

Here are the lines that resonated with me the most:

>In many ways, self-sabotage is a misguided form of protection. Self-sabotage “protects” you from playing big in a world where you were taught to play small.

>Setting boundaries or calling out toxic behavior isn’t hateful — it’s sacred and it should be taught in every spiritual practice.

>The ability to enjoy being alone is a goddamn superpower.

>Your hidden desires always have a way of speaking through your choices, no matter how hard you try to repress or silence them. In fact, you’ll find that when you don’t give these inner parts air time, they’ll find mischievous ways of coming out nonetheless. 

>Abundance and miracles are your birthright. Joy is best served without a side of shame. Grant your spirit space to play, to laugh, to experience the physical world down to every exquisite detail.

>The practice of gratitude comes with a caveat, because being grateful isn’t about being in denial. It’s about acknowledging the basic needs that are being met every day that you might otherwise take for granted. 

>That doesn’t mean closing yourself off to uncomfortable emotions in the process, because in the midst of the discomfort is where true change and catharsis can happen.

>It doesn’t mean not being angry or outraged when you are violated; in fact, **honoring your anger is just as sacred of a practice as being grateful.**

>Yet you’ll find that your soul thrives and manifests on a deeper level when nothing is forced at all, but honored for what it is, right here and now. Big dreams accelerate and come to life precisely when you’re willing to give up the resistance to what could be, rather than how you think they should be.

> Acknowledging that some things are better left broken and that some people are better off left to their own devices is the passport to your own liberation.

>Because deep down, your soul knows: sometimes the very things we think will save us are the things we need to be saved from — to pursue something even greater than we ever imagined.

Forcing something is not a solution. You just have to follow the force and it will lead you.


## [changing thought patterns](https://zenhabits.net/mindtraining/)

I am starting to notice that I live in many cognitive traps inside my mind. My mind is not working as freely as I feel, thoughts do form a patterns, repeating patterns, learned and adopted by my mind. <br>
I was noticing it before but what have changed after reading this article is mindset to take action and not only analyze but also try to change ~~negative~~ unhelpful thoughts. <br>
And what have also changed is the new of looking at thoughts, not as negative and positive, but as helpful and unhelpful.<br>

>The exact categorization of the thought pattern isn’t important — what matters is whether the thought pattern is helpful. What effect does it have on you when you think it? Is it moving you toward the life you want, or getting you stuck?Most of us aren’t aware when these thought patterns happen, so we’re beholden to their power without realizing it.To be clear, these aren’t “bad” thoughts — they’re natural and normal, but they aren’t always helpful.

**We can train our minds to use a more powerful thought pattern.** <br>
~ *You have to do this over and over.*

1. Catch yourself when you're using the old pattern.
2. Pause and acknowledge your fear.
3. Try new thought pattern.

Currently I am trying to change
>Nie uda mi się. Nie ogarnę tego, w końcu trafię na ścianę której nie przeskoczę. Do tej pory miałem fart.

to

>Chcę spróbować. Jeżeli odpowiednio się skupię to rozwiążę ten problem. A jeżeli nie to nie był on dla mnie.

**Life is complicatedly simple**, the threshold for mistakes is very big. Of course there are some things that I cannot afford to break but at the same time I should not be paralyzed by them and always prioritize it. Maybe it is more of a pool than ocean. If you stick to some rules you can play around and never drown.
